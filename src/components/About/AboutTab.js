      7G's objective from Day 1 has been to provide a one-of-a-kind resource and
      launchpad for Independent Artists, Filmmakers, and Designers — one that
      also serves as a unique aggregator and discovery hub for knowledgeable
      fans and enthusiasts appreciative of original, independently-produced
      work. The goal of 7GreenLights™ is to empower Independent Artists to share
      their creations with far greater, far more relevant, populations of fans
      and enthusiasts than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      7G values original storytellers who are willing to take risks to craft
      and impart their visions and narratives. We have designed Venues™ to
      recognize, to feature, and to increase discoverability of an incredible
      variety of Independent Artists, Filmmakers and Designers. We firmly
      believe that true fans of Independent Art, Film, and Design will
      appreciate the 7G platform, our mission, and the methods we develop and
      employ to improve the playing field for dedicated Independent Artists,
      Filmmakers, and Designers who are striving to generate visibility for
      their work on their own — without any labels or middlemen.
