      We built 7GreenLights™ to help Independent Artists, Filmmakers, Designers,
      and Developers make their work visible to greater, more relevant,
      audiences. We also wanted to help fans and enthusiasts discover content
      of interest to them, and potentially connect with the very artists and
      makers creating it. To assist in our pursuit of this goal, we developed
      Venues™ — location-specific, genre-based streaming hubs to which
      Independent Artists and other content-creators may post their work, from
      which fans and enthusiasts have the ability to curate their personal
      GreenLight® Streams™ (filtered by Venue™), and also happen to be
      time-sensitive with each Venue™ eventually being locked (to new posts) and
      archived for the continued benefit and entertainment of artists and fans
      alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      We expect Independent Artists who participate in Venues™ to experience a
      bonus from the increased awareness they will generate for one another by
      posting their work, collectively, to the same location. Every GreenLight®
      awarded to an artist's song or video by a fan on  will make it slightly
      more realistic for that artist to free himself or herself from whatever
      3rd parties are siphoning funds from his or her respective revenue streams
      (i.e. via streaming, downloads, tickets, merch, etc.). To a certain
      extent, every active artist on the site should experience an opportunity
      to leverage the spike in recognition of their work (however fleeting it
      may be) to increase their share of future earnings, and also to avoid
      any additional contracts that enable greedy 3rd parties to reap more
      revenue from their downloads, streams and work, in general, than they
      do themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have designed Venues™ to be driven and grown by Independent Artists and
      their fans. Our company's official motto is 'Momentum for the
      Independent®'.   intends to contribute to the success and financial
      security of Independent Artists and various other types of innovators from
      all over the world. We want to help dedicated Independent Artists and
      original storytellers thrive by making it easier for them to immerse
      themselves in their actual crafts and creative endeavors, rather than the
      marketing and promoting of them. We also want to help those Independent
      Artists who most listeners and/or viewers would agree — after streaming
      their song or video — probably should have at least 10X the
      fans/plays/follows that they count currently. We want to enable these
      artists' work to flourish by providing them with a platform that makes it
      far simpler, and less time- and energy-intensive, for them to share their
      work and connect with potential fans who, at the moment, are unaware they
      exist.

      Every unique Venue™ is a potential time capsule/launchpad/streaming hub
      all its own. The upside for Independent Artists is the opportunity to
      increase visibility of their work among relevant, engaged fans. The upside
      for fans and enthusiasts is the opportunity to discover and GreenLight®
      the dedicated Independent Artists who speak to them. The more
      Independent Artists, Filmmakers, Designers and Developers who post their
      work to Venues™ the more interesting and captivating each of these Venues™
      will be for fans, in terms of their ability to discover compelling voices
      and creators, and to access and enjoy their work. 7G™ is constantly
      developing, testing, and implementing fan-focused 'in-house' features and
      functionality (such as 'Venues™', 'GreenLight® Pop', 'Blasts™', and
      Notes™) to ensure that the experience for fans and enthusiasts is
      optimized as much as it is for artists.

      Stay tuned for 7G's Venue-driven™ causes of 2016!
