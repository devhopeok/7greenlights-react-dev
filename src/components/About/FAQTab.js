      <b>What's a GreenLight™?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      At first glance, a GreenLight™ may seem to be the mere equivalent of a
      'Like' on Facebook or a 'Follow' on Twitter, but the benefits provided by
      7G's GreenLight™ service far exceed the ones associated with either of
      those features. First of all, every time you GreenLight™ another 7G member
      (or are GreenLit™ by one) the user who you GreenLight™ potentially gains
      more access to your 7G profile — depending on your privacy settings — and
      you, theirs. Alright, so that in itself isn't exactly novel, but there's
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every 7G accountholder belongs to one of four following 'GreenLight™
      Populations' from the perspective of every other user on the platform:
      'GreenLight™ Pop A' — accountholder's exchanged GreenLights™ with another
      user; 'GreenLight™ Pop B' — accountholder's GreenLit™ a specific user,
      but not vice versa; 'GreenLight™ Pop C' — a specific user's GreenLit™ the
      accountholder, but not vice versa; and 'GreenLight™ Pop D' — no
      GreenLights™ issued either way. Every 7G accountholder is able to preset
      other users' respective access to their personal 7G profile and activity
      throughout the platform according to these four 'GreenLight™ Populations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Every 7G member also has the ability to GreenLight™ more than just other
      users. 7G members are able to GreenLight™ content (e.g. songs, videos,
      etc.) posted to the site by other users as well. Every time a 7G
      accountholder issues a GreenLight™ to another user's song or video, the
      accountholder effectively fine-tunes his or her streaming preferences. All
      7G users can access, filter, sort, and stream content that they
      GreenLight™ on the platform thanks to our patent-pending "7G Stream™."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, 7G members also have the ability to GreenLight™ specific 7G
      Venues™ of interest to them in addition to any Notes™ or Blasts™ posted by
      other users.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What are Notes™?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notes™ are images, short video clips or audio clips posted by other users
      that 7G accountholders have the ability to feature alongside their
      personal content that they post to the 7G platform. One of the drawbacks
      that comes with the ease and immediacy of this digital age seems to be the
      short 'shelf-life' of content posted to the web. Notes™ are our way of
      combatting peoples' goldfish attention spans. For example, how many times
      are you going to keep returning to the 7G platform (or any other streaming
        platform for that matter) to replay a song or video over and over.
      Unless you're completely obsessed with the song or video, the odds are
      probably not more than once or twice. You might purchase the song or add
      it to one of your Spotify® playlists, but most people will not continue
      playing the same song or video repeatedly over the course of several
      days/weeks/months.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the content-creator was able to feature images and clips posted by fans
      alongside their song or video, however, we think you might at least be
      interested in checking those out on a daily or weekly basis. Hence, our
      Notes™ feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What's a Blast™?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
       7G developed the Blast™ functionality in order to equip all of our users
       with their own personal 'megaphones' essentially. Playing a show Friday
       night at The Knockout? Post a Blast™ to let people know about it. 7G
       Members also have been given the ability to target their Blasts to their
       specific GreenLight™ Populations™ — for example, if you want to share an
       exclusive announcement with 7G users who you've exchanged GreenLights™
       with, simply target your Blast™ to your Pop A's. This might sound similar
       to the functionality found on Twitter, but we assure you Blasts™ offer
       several additional features that we think you will find very useful. For
       example, every 7G member's latest Blast™ also appears alongside any song
       or video that they post to a 7G Venue™ (using patent-pending
        functionality). We believe this will enhance discoverability of emerging
       artists by enabling potential fans and enthusiasts to glimpse
       content-creators' latest announcements when said fans and enthusiasts
       otherwise would be unlikely to have an opportunity to do so based on a
       lack of direct interaction with them or maybe not even knowing that those
       artists exist!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What's a 7G Venue™?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The 7G Venue™ is the featured functionality of the entire 7G platform. 7G
      Venues™ are location-specific, genre- and content-based (i.e. SF Rock
      Songs, Cleveland Soul Videos, etc.) events/aggregations/destinations.
      7G Venues™ are digitally-created music, film and design venues that
      Independent Artists, Filmmakers and Designers can post their work to and
      connect with relevant fans in the process. 7G intends to partner with
      select brick-and-mortar venues and other genuine supporters of Independent
      Music, Film, and Design who are interested in supporting the cause and
      innovating with us along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our thinking is, Why should you as an Independent Artist, Filmmaker or
      Designer attempt to share your work and grow your fanbase on your own
      "YouTube island" (or 'Bandcamp/SoundCloud/Vimeo/Etsy island') — through
      your own network(s) and isolated efforts — when you can essentially 'pool
      your resources' with similarly situated artists, creating and producing in
      the same genres and mediums, if ALL of you are willing to post your work
      to 7G Venues™ thereby leveraging the SYNERGY generated among ALL of your
      respective networks and fans in order to collectively "share your work at
      the speed of 7G."
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone stands to benefit — fans and artists alike.
